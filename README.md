# Analytics-Vidhya---Loan-Prediction-
Loan prediction data set


i have created a machine learning model on jupiter notebook.
I have used Decision Tree classifier and Random forest Classifier for predicting.
The dataset was imported from analytics vidhya.
I used basic seaborn and matplotlib library for data visualization and basic EDA.
All the null values were imputed.
